## Module 3 In-Class Assignment

You are investigating the zonal wind a geopotential heights at 500 hPa around the 50.0 degree latitude circle (in both northern and souther hemisphere). The following data have been collected from GFS Analyses over the September - November 2017 time period:

[Data File](sample_data.nc)

Your goal is to create an analysis notebook that does the following:

- A single figure that summarizes the data set (perhaps a Hovm√∂ller diagram may do the trick?)
- Derive wave number, amplitude, and speed from height data
- Time series analysis of a relavant meteorological quantity
- Investigate correlations between
	- Wave Speed vs. Zonal Wind
	- Wave Speed vs. Wave Number
	- Wave Amplitude vs. Wave Number
